## App Bundle Creation Plan (Low Priority - Future Enhancement)

### Objective
Create a true double-clickable macOS app bundle (ChessVermouth.app) that eliminates the need for Terminal navigation while maintaining the current CLI functionality.

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: App Bundle Structure**
```
ChessVermouth.app/
├── Contents/
│   ├── Info.plist          # App metadata and configuration
│   ├── MacOS/
│   │   └── ChessVermouth   # Executable launcher script
│   └── Resources/
│       └── chess-icon.icns # Application icon
```

**Phase 2: Launcher Script**
Create executable that:
- Detects if Node.js is available
- Shows user-friendly error if setup needed
- Launches `chessvermouth.js` automatically
- Handles working directory navigation
- Provides macOS-native error dialogs

**Phase 3: Distribution Package**
```
ChessVermouth.dmg/
├── ChessVermouth.app/     # Main application
├── Applications/          # Shortcut to Applications folder
├── background.png         # Visual instructions
└── README.txt            # Simple setup instructions
```

**Phase 4: Enhanced Install Script**
Modify `install.sh` to:
- Create the .app bundle automatically
- Generate DMG distribution package
- Code-sign the app (optional, for Gatekeeper)
- Create both CLI and GUI entry points

### User Experience Flow
```
Download ChessVermouth.dmg → Double-click DMG → 
Drag ChessVermouth.app to Applications → 
Double-click ChessVermouth.app → 
Game menu appears automatically!
```

### Technical Requirements
- **No Terminal knowledge required**
- **Works from any location** (Downloads, Desktop, Applications)
- **Handles missing dependencies gracefully**
- **Maintains CLI functionality** for power users
- **Cross-platform compatible** (Windows/Linux variants)

### Files to Create
1. `create-app-bundle.sh` - App bundle generator
2. `ChessVermouth.applescript` - AppleScript wrapper (backup method)
3. Enhanced `install.sh` with DMG creation
4. App icon design and creation

### Benefits
- **Consumer-grade experience** for everyday users
- **Familiar macOS conventions** (app in Applications folder)
- **No directory navigation required**
- **Professional appearance** vs CLI scripts
- **Gatekeeper compatibility** (with code signing)

This enhancement transforms ChessVermouth from a developer-friendly setup to a consumer-ready application while preserving all existing functionality.

## Missing Core Features

## Technical Limitations to Address

| Priority | Status | Issue | Description | Category |
